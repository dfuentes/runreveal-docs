# Sources
RunReveal sources usually work via three different methods.

 - API Polling Sources - RunReveal pulls the logs.
 - Webhook sources - Logs are pushed to RunReveal.
 - S3 Sources - Logs are batched to S3, where RunReveal reads them.

The provider that we're integrating with dictates the method that RunReveal
uses to receives logs.
