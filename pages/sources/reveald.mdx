# reveald log collection

[Reveald](https://github.com/runreveal/reveald) is an open source log collection
agent that is efficient, performant and simple.

Reveald supports a variety of host-level log sources and is appropriate to use
in any situation where the logs aren't already being collected to an S3 bucket
or accessible via another first-party API.

To get your logs into RunReveal via reveald, we'll first create a reveald source
in the RunReveal UI, which will give us a webhookURL to use as the target to
send our logs to from reveald.

Next, download a reveald release for the operating system and architecture of
the host you'll be running the daemon on from the [releases page on
github](https://github.com/runreveal/reveald/releases).  Extract the package to
a directory of your choosing.

As of this writing, reveald supports the following sources:

- syslog
- file
- journald
- mqtt
- nginx (via syslog)

And the following destinations:

- runreveal
- s3
- printer
- mqtt

You can see examples of how to configure reveald for each of these sources in
the example config file provided in the repository's examples directory, or an
abridged example config below.

Replace `{{YOUR-REVEALD-WEBHOOKURL}}` with the webhook given in the UI.

```
{
  // this is an example config file for kawa
  // it is parsed using hujson so you can use comments and trailing commas, but
  // is otherwise identical to JSON
  "sources": {
    // The keys here are the identifiers for the sources, and are used to
    // refernece them when logging or in metrics.
    "kubernetes": {
      "type": "file",
      "path": "/var/log/pods/",
      "extension": ".log",
    },
    "myjournald": {
      "type": "journald",
    },
    // "mynginx": {
    //   "type": "nginx_syslog",
    //   "addr": "0.0.0.0:5514",
    // },
  },
  "destinations": {
    "runreveal": {
      "type": "runreveal",
      // Replace this webhook URL with your own, created on https://www.runreveal.com
      // as a "Reveald" type source
      "webhookURL": "https://example.runreveal.com/sources/kawa/webhook/0123456789",
      // You can also use environment variables by referencing them with a
      // dollar sign. The value must be quoted, start with a dollar sign and be
      // a valid environment variable name
      // "webhookURL": "$WEBHOOK_URL",
    },
    // "lumbermill": {
    //  "type": "s3",
    //  "bucketName": "the-lumber-mill",
    //  "bucketRegion": "us-west-2",
    // },
  },
}
```

This is a valid config file if you're running on Linux.  We can run reveald
pointing at the configuration like so (assuming you download it to the same
directory as the binary).

```
./reveald run --config=./config.json
```

If configured correctly, you should start seeing the journald logs and kubelet
pod logs (if the host is running a kubelet) in your RunReveal workspace.
