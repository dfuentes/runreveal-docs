# Detection Data Model
All results, from all detection queries that execute, are saved to the `detections` table.

The detections table contains several fields.
- `id` - `String` - Unique identified of the run
- `scheduledRunID` - `String` - The unique identifier of the scheduled query run
- `workspaceID` - `String` - Your workspace ID
- `detectionID` - `String` - The identified of the detection
- `detectionName` - `String` - The name of the detection
- `recordsReturned` - `Int32` - The number of rows returned by the query
- `runTime` - `Int64` - The number of nanoseconds the query took to run
- `query` - `String` - The actual query that was run for the scheduled query
- `params` - `Map(String, String)` - The supplied parameters to the scheduled query
- `columnNames` - `Array(String)` - An ordered array of column names returned by the query
- `columnTypes` - `Array(String)` - An ordered array of the column types returned by the query
- `results` - `String` - An array of the first 100 returned values from the query
- `severity` - `String` - A string representing the severity of the alert
- `actor` - `Map(String, String)` - Details about the user that ran the query
- `resources` - `Array(String)` DEFAULT [] - Details about the resources returned from the query
- `srcIP` - `String` - Details about the srcIP in the log entries
- `dstIP` - `String` - Details about the dstIPs from the log entries
- `notificationNames` - `Array(String)` - The names of the notification channels
- `categories` - `Array(String)` DEFAULT [] - The categories that the query belongs to
- `mitreAttacks` - `Array(LowCardinality(String))` DEFAULT [] - The MITRE ATT&CK technique categories that the query belongs to

This table is useful for combining detections and results. There are two helpful views on top of this.

- `alerts` - The same table as the `detections` table except it only contains entries where an alert was sent to a notification channel.
- `signals` - The same table as the `detections` table except it only contains entries where an alert was _not_ sent to a notification channel.

These tables can be accessed like any other table in RunReveal

To query the detection table:
```
select * from detections
```

To query the signals view:
```
select * from signals
```

To query the alerts view:
```
select * from alerts
```
